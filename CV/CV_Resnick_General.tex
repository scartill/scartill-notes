	\textbf{SUMMARY}
	\vspace{5mm}

	Software designer, development manager, and architect with two decades of experience building complex, scalable systems from the ground up. I have a proven track record of creating new development teams and mentoring top-tier engineers to deliver high-quality, efficient software solutions. My expertise includes leveraging new technologies to solve complex problems, managing large-scale, multi-vendor collaborations, and architecting robust systems that are both compliant and highly performant. I am now leveraging this experience to advise on data-driven and AI-supported solutions in new industries, with a specific interest in online retail.
