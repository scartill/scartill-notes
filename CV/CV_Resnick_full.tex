	\textbf{SUMMARY}
	\vspace{5mm}

	Software designer, development manager, and architect working in the aviation, UAS, and aerospace industry for almost two decades. I have built multiple development teams from a scratch and mentored a good deal of superior developers. Insight into the mechanism of industrial aerospace standardization allows me to build systems in a compliant and efficient manner.

	The latest focus was of my work was leveraging 5G networks capabilities to enable BVLOS UAV operations.

	My general experience includes a wide range of skills in automation software design, ground-based aviation navigation and communication systems, GNSS (GPS) Navigation, GIS, and a broad set of programming languages, technologies, and tools.
